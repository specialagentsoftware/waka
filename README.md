# waka

This was a simple python script that continually sent hearbeats to WakaTime. It is a time reporting service that fovuses on software development. Essentially, with this python acript you can automate the reporting of work that you may or may not have actually done. It randomly picks a file from the list you define and creates a heartbeat to show that the file was updated within your ide via a user agent. The effect is that you spent time editing X number of different files for as long as you have the script running.
